# HMM

Python implementation of Hidden Markov Models. Each model permits for having
multiple emissions per state and can deal with missing observations.

Implemented models:
*     Multinomial HMMs
*     Gaussian HMMs
*     HMM with labels

Easily extendable with other types of probabilistic models.
