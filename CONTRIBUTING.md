# Contributing to PyHHMM
Thank you for taking the time to contribute. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure to format your code similarly to ours.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache Licence 2.0

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/fmorenopino/HeterogeneousHMM/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy! Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.
