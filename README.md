HMM
===

Full implementation made on Python, hmmlearn is just used to generate synthetic data to test the model. 

This model works with: 

- Gaussian observations.

- Multiple features per observation. 

- Multiple sequences (look at "main_multiple_sequences.py" to see an example).

Pending:

- Implementation on missing data.
